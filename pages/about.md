## About the Collection

For my SLIS 5030 collection project at the University of Iowa, I curated selected photographs of my nephew, R. at the library or in his natural state of play. At the time of this project, R. is three weeks shy of turning four years old, so he seems to like playing, the library, and playing at the library. These photographs are meant for family and friends who have or have not met R. to enjoy, but also for R. himself when he gets older, as they are a snapshot of what life was like for him as a toddler.
